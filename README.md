## Introduction
This project aims to predict the occurrence of heart failure based on various clinical features. The app provides a user-friendly interface for inputting patient data and obtaining predictions using machine learning models.


## Installation

To run the Hangman Game locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **To Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/purna333/Heart-Failure_Prediction
    ```

## Usage
I deployed this app by using the streamlit
### Step 1 : Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py

### step 2 : Access the app in your browser at 'http://localhost:8501'.
Here it looks like when you open in your browser

## Models
The app utilizes the following models for heart failure prediction:

- Random Forest Model
- Logistic Regression Model
- Decision Tree Model

Each model was trained using a labeled dataset and achieved high accuracy in predicting heart failure.

## Dataset
The dataset can be found at [Dataset](https://github.com/purna333/Heart-Failure_Prediction/blob/main/heart_failure.csv)
